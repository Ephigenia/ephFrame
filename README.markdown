ephFrame PHP Framework Readme File
==============================================================================

ephFrame is an other framework written in PHP5 and wants to be easy to use,
simple and not to heavy weighted. It focuses on
[DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) and
[convention over configuration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) principle. It's build like many other frameworks with some 
differences in detail and also uses the [MVC pattern](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_Controller).

See the [WIKI Documentation](http://github.com/Ephigenia/ephFrame/wiki), which i just started writing. If youâ€™re 
allready working with the framework you should check the 
[changelog.markdown](http://github.com/Ephigenia/ephFrame/blob/master/changelog.markdown) from time to time.
